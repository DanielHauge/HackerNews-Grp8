## Requirements, architecture, design and process
```
This section describes the requirements of the project, the architecture that you have chosen,  
the design of the actual components and the process you undertook to build them in the end.
```
#### System requirements
```
This section should contain an elaborate description of the requirements for the project.  
This includes the scope of the Hackernews clone (what should it be able to do / what should it not be able to do).
```
The system was a minimal functional clone of the original Hackernews website, which was a system that allowed users to share and discuss stories with a focus on programming and information systems, the system allows self regulation by allowing users to increase the visibility of some discussions, and for long time users to decrease the visibilty of others.  
The system had to handle multiple users posting stories and comments at the same time, while also having a minimum 95% uptime even while part of the system was down for upgrading. The system had to allow users to make a program that can simulate user interaction that creates stories and comments using a REST API, also to query the latest ingested story. likewise the users should also be able to do these actions using a web browser as well.

#### Development process
```
In this part you should show off by telling us all you know about software development processes  
and describe which concepts you used to structure your development.
```

#### Software architecture
```
In this section you illustrate and describe the architecture of your Hackernews clone.  
That is, you describe how your system is structured and how the different  
parts interact and communicate with each other.
```

#### Software design
```
Here you should sketch your thoughts on the software design before you started  
implementing the system. This includes describing the technical concerns you had  
about the system before you started development, together with all the technical  
components you came up with to fix these concerns and meet the requirements.
```

#### Software implementation
```
This section should describe your actual implementation. Mainly how well you  
followed the requirements, process and software design you began with. If your  
system changed during this phase you should summarise the unexpected  
events/problems and explain how you solved them.
```

## Maintenance and SLA status
```
This section describes the process of maintaining the software over time,  
starting from the hand-over to the shutting down of your system. The section  
should be written from the viewpoint of the operator, not the developers.
```

#### Hand-over
```
In this part, you should describe the hand-over of the system you were operating.  
Specifically you should comment on the quality of the documentation you received  
and whether you felt well equipped to maintaining the system.
```

#### Service-level agreement
```
Here you should include the service level agreement you entered together with the group  
you were operating, including the metric itself and the threshold you agreed upon for  
that metric. If you had any disagreements about the SLA you should describe them and  
explain how you found an agreement.
```

#### Maintenance and reliability
```
This part should contain a description on how you experienced the actual operation.  
Explain how you actually monitored the system to ensure that the SLA was upheld, and  
describe any incidents you experienced that broke (or could potentially break) the SLA.  
Remember to include documentation for each incident! Finally you should conclude  
how well the developers responded to your issues and conclude on how reliable the  
system was overall.
```

## Discussion
```
...
```

#### Technical discussion
```
This part summarises both the first and second part of the report by giving an overview  
of the good and bad parts of the whole semester project. Be critical and honest.
```

#### Group work reflection & Lessons learned
```
Give a short reflection on what were the three most important things you learned  
during the project. The lessons learned are with regards to both, what worked well  
and what worked not well. These reflections can cover anything from the sections  
above. That is, development process, architectural and design decisions,  
implementation, maintenance, etc. If you chose to use roles (project manager,  
architect, devops etc.) you should use those to reflect on whether they  
improved the process or not.

Additionally, focus on both, your work as developers as well as operators.
